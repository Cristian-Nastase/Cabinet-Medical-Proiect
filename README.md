- **Semantic HTML5:** Structure optimized for accessibility and SEO.
- **SCSS (Sass):** Utilized for modularizing styles through partials, design tokens (variables), and controlled nesting.
- **BEM Methodology (Block Element Modifier):** Rigorously implemented to ensure predictable, isolated, and maintainable CSS.
- **Handmade Responsive Design:** Fluid layouts achieved using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and custom Media Queries.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Implementation of interactive elements (mobile navigation toggle, carousel logic, scroll effects) without external dependencies.
